# selenium-python
This project was made using Python and the Selenium package.

## Installation
You will need to install Python and Selenium.
Python is available here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You can then install Selenium with the following command: pip install selenium.

After you have installed both you will need a chromedriver, which you can get here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

Make sure to download the driver for the version of Chrome which you **currently have installed**. Besides that, make sure that the driver is placed next to the code.

## Running the program
You can simply run the code in an IDE (like PyCharm) or run it in a shell with the command: python3 selenium-hw.py

## Other
Answers to the bonus questions can be found at the bottom of the code.
The code is equipped with comments so you know which step of the instructions was implemented in my program.
